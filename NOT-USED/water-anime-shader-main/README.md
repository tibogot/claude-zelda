# Anime Water Scene — Creative Boilerplate

An anime/cel-shaded water scene built with Next.js, Three.js, and React Three Fiber.
This repository showcases a real-time stylized water system inspired by Blender's Dynamic Paint workflow, recreated entirely in WebGL using custom GLSL shaders.

## 🌊 WaterFloor System

The core of this project is the `WaterFloor` component — a modular, layered water rendering system composed of several independent passes that work together to produce the final anime water look.

### Architecture

```

├── index.tsx                        # Main water surface (Voronoi cel-shading + ripple rings)
├── useWaterRipple.ts                # Hook — attach to any object to emit water ripples
├── shaders/                         # WaterFloor GLSL shaders
├── utils/controls.ts                # Leva GUI controls
├── stores/

└── components/
    ├── SeabedFloor/                 # Animated Voronoi seabed (parallax depth layer)
    ├── ShadowCatcher/               # Receives shadows on the seabed plane
    ├── WaterSparkles/               # Procedural 4-pointed star particles on the surface
    ├── WaterDepthIntersection/      # Screen-space depth intersection glow
    └── WaterWaveSimulation/         # PDE-based ping-pong wave simulation
```

### Rendering Passes

#### 1. Seabed Floor (`SeabedFloor`)
An animated Voronoi pattern rendered below the water surface, visible through the transparent deep-color areas of the water. Slower cell movement than the surface creates a parallax depth illusion.

#### 2. Water Surface (`WaterFloor`)
Cel-shaded water using a **Voronoi F1 − SmoothF1** subtraction, replicating the Blender node graph approach in GLSL. World-space XZ coordinates keep the pattern anchored regardless of camera movement.

Features:
- 3-stop color ramp (deep → mid → highlight)
- Animated cell positions with noise-based UV distortion
- Hard-edged anime ripple rings driven by `rippleStore`
- Distance fade for infinite-floor look

#### 3. Water Depth Intersection (`WaterDepthIntersection`)
Screen-space depth comparison technique. The DragonBalls geometry is rendered into a depth-only render target each frame. A fullscreen plane at the water surface compares its own depth against the scene depth to detect geometry crossing the water plane, drawing:
- A sharp white silhouette line at the exact intersection
- A soft blue halo glow around it

DPR-aware: uses physical pixel dimensions so the effect stays aligned at any device pixel ratio.

#### 4. Wave Simulation (`WaterWaveSimulation`)
A three-pass GPU wave simulation per frame:

1. **Injection pass** — top-down orthographic render of the DragonBalls geometry clipped to a thin band around the water surface. Produces the exact waterline shape in simulation UV space.
2. **Wave update pass** (ping-pong) — runs the 2D wave PDE each frame:
   `h_next = 2·h_cur − h_prev + c²·∇²h`
   Absorbing boundaries prevent edge reflections.
3. **Display pass** — computes gradient magnitude of the height map; high gradient = ring edge, rendered as an additive overlay.

#### 5. Water Sparkles (`WaterSparkles`)
GPU particle system using `gl_PointCoord` to draw procedural 4-pointed star shapes — no textures required. Each particle fades in/out over its lifetime using a sine curve.

#### 6. Ripple System (`useWaterRipple`)
A composable hook that can be attached to any R3F object. Emits ripple events to `rippleStore` when the object enters the water (entry splash) and periodically while submerged. The water surface shader reads these events and renders concentric anime-style rings.
